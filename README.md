# FreeGPT WebUI 
## GPT 3.5/4

<strong>NOT REQUIRE ANY API KEY</strong> ❌🔑 

This project features a WebUI utilizing the [G4F API](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free). <br>
Experience the power of ChatGPT with a user-friendly interface, enhanced jailbreaks, and completely free.

## Known bugs 🚧
- Stream mode not working properly.

## News 📢
I have created a new version of FreeGPT WebUI using the [ChimeraGPT API](https://chimeragpt.adventblocks.cc/). 
<br>
<br>
This free API allows you to use various AI chat models, including <strong>GPT-4, GPT-4-32k, llama-2 and more.</strong> <br>
Check out the project here: [FreeGPT WebUI - Chimera Version](https://github.com/ramonvc/freegpt-webui/tree/chimeragpt-version).

## Project Hosting and Demonstration 🌐🚀
The project is hosted on multiple platforms to be tested and modified.

## Note ℹ️ 
<p>
  FreeGPT is a project that utilizes various free AI conversation API Providers. Each Provider is an API that provides responses generated by different AI models. The source code related to these services is available in <a href="https://github.com/ramonvc/freegpt-webui/tree/main/g4f">G4F folder</a>.

It is important to note that, due to the extensive reach of this project, the free services registered here may receive a significant number of requests, which can result in temporary unavailability or access limitations. Therefore, it is common to encounter these services being offline or unstable.

We recommend that you search for your own Providers and add them to your personal projects to avoid service instability and unavailability. Within the project, in the <a href="https://github.com/ramonvc/freegpt-webui/tree/main/g4f/Provider/Providers">Providers folder</a>, you will find several examples of Providers that have worked in the past or are still functioning. It is easy to follow the logic of these examples to find free GPT services and incorporate the requests into your specific FreeGPT project.

Please note that the choice and integration of additional Providers are the user's responsibility and are not directly related to the FreeGPT project, as the project serves as an example of how to combine the <a href="https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free">G4F API</a> with a web interface.
